	     	I am very happy to be in gschool and gain a valuable set of tools that I can constantly improve and build on. I have a passion for entrepreneurship and know that in today's world, knowing how to code is imperative to 99% of entrepreneurship. After gschool I would like to become an instant billionaire (what? it could happen) but seriously I would love to be able to start my own venture, work for a really cool innovative company, or both. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
